        <p>King trumpet mushrooms, also known as king oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus eryngii), are a large, thick-stemmed variety of oyster mushroom appreciated for their firm, meaty texture and savory, slightly nutty flavor that makes them an excellent meat substitute in dishes like vegan "scallops," shredded for tacos, or sliced for stir-fries and grilling. They are a good source of the antioxidant ergothioneine. (source: Google Overview) </p>
