    This web production class has been one of the most rewarding courses I’ve taken this semester. It pushed me to think creatively while also building real technical skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and interactive design. I especially appreciated how the class balanced structure with creative freedom, allowing projects to feel personal while still teaching industry-relevant concepts. Professor Laura Splan created a supportive and engaging learning environment where experimentation was encouraged and questions were always welcomed. Her guidance, feedback, and passion for web design made the class both challenging and enjoyable, and it truly elevated my confidence as a creator. I’m very grateful for everything I’ve learned this semester and want to thank Professor Splan for a wonderful class. Wishing her a happy, relaxing holiday season and all the best moving forward.
