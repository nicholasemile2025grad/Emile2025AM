      <h2>Did you know?</h2>
      <li>The first rulebook contained just 13 rules — simple, clear, and built for play.</li>
      <li>Did you know the NBA rule book includes a detailed plan for a "disaster draft" in case a team loses five or more players in a catastrophic event (like a plane crash or arena collapse)? 
This rule, though thankfully never used, outlines how the affected team would rebuild its roster by allowing them to select unprotected players from other franchises. Each of the other teams could protect up to five of their own players, forcing difficult choices between star veterans and younger talent. The disaster-stricken team would also receive the number one draft pick in the next draft in addition to their own, and would still have to manage their roster within the salary cap</li>
