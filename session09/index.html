        <h2 id="origins">Origins of the Game</h2>
        <p>Basketball was invented in December 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a Canadian physical education instructor at Springfield College in Massachusetts. Naismith wrote down 13 original rules and used a soccer ball and peach baskets. The game was invented as an indoor sport to keep students active during winter.</p>

        <h2 id="early-growth">Early Growth</h2>
        <p>Within a few years basketball spread through colleges and YMCAs across the United States. By the early 1900s women and men were both playing versions of the game—each adapted to different contexts. Organized professional play began in the early 20th century and would later evolve into the leagues we know today.</p>

        <h2 id="nba-history">The NBA Era</h2>
        <p>In 1946 the Basketball Association of America (BAA) was founded; in 1949 the BAA and the National Basketball League merged to create the NBA. The NBA professionalized the sport, created national TV audiences, and eventually became an international cultural phenomenon.</p>

        <h2 id="global">Global Expansion</h2>
        <p>Basketball's global growth accelerated in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. International players, the Olympic Games, and global media have helped make basketball a major global sport. The NBA now features players from dozens of countries and a worldwide following.</p>
