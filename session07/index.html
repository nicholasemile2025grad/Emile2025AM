          <h3>What is <em>Echinodontium tinctorium</em>?</h3>
          <p>
            <em>Echinodontium tinctorium</em>, commonly called the <strong>Indian paint fungus</strong> or toothed conk, is a woody shelf fungus in the family <em>Echinodontiaceae</em> that occurs in western North America. The fruiting bodies are hoof- or shelf-shaped and woody; their undersides are covered in blunt, grayish teeth (rather than pores) that distinguish them from many polypores. The fresh interior (context) of the conk is often a cinnamon to deep reddish-orange color, which led to historical use as a pigment by indigenous peoples. The species is a wood-decay fungus and acts as a parasite or heart-rot agent on several conifer hosts.

          <h3 id="habitat">Habitat, range, and hosts</h3>
          <p>
            <em>E. tinctorium</em> is primarily found in the Pacific Northwest and adjacent mountain ranges (including Cascades and Sierra Nevada), growing on living or recently dead conifers. Common hosts include true firs (<em>Abies</em> spp., especially grand fir), western hemlock (<em>Tsuga heterophylla</em>), and occasionally Douglas-fir and spruce. The fungus typically indicates internal heart-rot or a decayed core in living trees and is frequently encountered at mid- to high-elevations in older forests. It is considered part of the natural wood-decay community in these forests.

          <h3 id="identification">Identification & features</h3>
          <p>
            Fruiting bodies are hoof-shaped, hard and woody, typically 8–20 cm wide (though sizes vary). The upper surface can be cracked, dull, and darker (often blackish or grayish), while the lower surface bears small blunt teeth (the "toothed" hymenium). A distinctive field character is the warm reddish or cinnamon-colored interior when the conk is cut or broken. Spore print color is reported as white; microscopic examination is required for confident scientific identification. Note: this species is inedible due to its woody texture.

          <h3 id="uses">Traditional uses & dyeing</h3>
          <p>
            Indigenous groups in the Pacific Northwest used the red interior as a pigment — for body paint, designs, and sometimes as a skin protectant against chapping. Modern natural-dye practitioners also experiment with the fungus to obtain reddish-orange dyes; results depend on preparation and mordants (chemical helpers used in dyeing). Despite these uses, the fungus is not eaten.

        <section>
          <h3 id="ecology">Ecological role</h3>
          <p>
            As a wood-decay fungus it contributes to nutrient cycling and the formation of wildlife habitat (hollow trunks, softened heartwood). By causing heart-rot, it can predispose trees to structural weakness and tree-fall, which are natural processes in old-growth and mature forests. While it affects individual trees, it is considered a normal component of forest ecosystems rather than an unusual pathogen of concern at a wide scale.

            For identification consult regional field guides (for example Arora's <em>Mushrooms Demystified</em> or localized guides like <em>California Mushrooms</em> / <em>Mushrooms of Cascadia</em>). Collections databases (CalPhotos, iNaturalist, Mushroom Observer, and regional herbaria) provide up-to-date photos and specimen records for range and phenology comparisons.
