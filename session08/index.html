		<h1>The History of Basketball</h1>
		<p>From its invention in 1891 to its global rise today</p>

		<h2 id="origins">Origins of the Game</h2>
		<p>Basketball was invented in December 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a Canadian physical education instructor at Springfield College in Massachusetts. Naismith created the game as an indoor sport to keep students active during the cold winter months. The first game used a soccer ball and two peach baskets as goals.</p>

		<h2 id="early-growth">Early Growth</h2>
		<p>The sport quickly gained popularity, spreading across colleges and YMCAs in the United States. In 1898, the first professional basketball league was formed, known as the National Basketball League. Though it only lasted six years, it laid the foundation for organized professional play.</p>

		<h2 id="nba-history">The NBA Era</h2>
		<p>In 1946, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) was founded, later merging with the National Basketball League to form the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1949. The NBA transformed basketball into a major sport, introducing stars like Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James.</p>

		<h2 id="global">Global Expansion</h2>
		<p>Today, basketball is one of the most popular sports worldwide. The NBA includes international players from over 40 countries, and the game continues to grow through global events like the Olympics and FIBA World Cup. From neighborhood courts to professional arenas, basketball connects people everywhere.</p>
